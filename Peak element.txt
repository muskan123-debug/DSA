An element is called a peak element if its value is not smaller than the value of its adjacent elements(if they exists).
Given an array arr[] of size N, Return the index of any one of its peak elements.

int peakElement(int arr[], int n)
{
   // Your code here
  
   
   int s = 0, e = n-1;
   
   while(s<e){
       int mid = (s+e)/2;
       
       if(arr[mid]>arr[mid+1]){
           e= mid;
       }
       else{
           s = mid+1;
       }
   }
   return e;
}
